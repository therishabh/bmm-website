                                    <p>Weddings are a true-blue gala affair, celebrated with pomp and show almost everywhere across the world but more so, in a country like India. Our weddings witness a galore like no other day with the family, bride, groom and guests looking nothing short of royals. Especially for the bride, looking better than her best on all important functions including engagement, mehndi, sangeet, sagan, shaadi and reception party has been in vogue since a long time now. However, recently over the past decade or so, wedding extravaganza has seen an exceptional rise and popularity with millennials who are splurging like before on everything.</p>
                                    <p>Bridalwear- The Main Attraction!</p>
                                    <p>Bridal outfits, in particular, have become a major area that is increasingly important and at the core of the entire affair. They are not only the eye-catchers of the entire events but also the main attraction of the forever memorable pictures captured of those beautiful days. Brides are ready to spend millions of bucks on looking like a princess on their wedding functions while even those who are more economical are inventing creative ideas to be their utmost fashionable in the set budget.</p>
                                    <p>Clearly, when the eyes of the hundreds of guests invited to your event are set on you and your look and with all those beautiful moments are to be collected in an album to live forever down the lane, every bride wants to nail the best look. And for all those wonderful yet fairly stressed out brides worrying over their looks, we have put together a few ideas and tips on dressing right for every important occasion.</p>
                                    <p><b>1. Engagement-</b> First up is the big event of an engagement ceremony which is indeed a very vital event for a bride as she will be introduced as the would-be wife of the groom to his extended family and friends for the very first time.</p>
                                    <p> Brides usually prefer to keep it simple yet uber classy on this one by opting for either a colour block or shimmery evening gown, mostly with a western touch yet nothing too revealing to garner just the right attention. Popular colours brides should go for are pastel shades, shimmery metallic like silver, golds or even lighter hues of pinks maybe. Try not to go for the dark tints, especially reds or too heavy work as this is just the first event and you want to keep it less experimental. Keep it young and contemporary should be the mantra.</p>
                                    <p><b>2. Mehndi-</b> Next up in line is the relatively less grand yet equally enjoyable event of the entire wedding saga, mehndi. The ritual of application of henna on the bride’s hands is an age-old tradition in almost every Hindu wedding, especially the Punjabis. From free-flowing drinks to one hell of a dance party, mehndi ceremony is everything fun.</p>
                                    <p> It’s best to be at your comfortable best on this one and opt for no-fuss kurta-skirt or kurta-sharara look or even a full length anarkali so that you enjoy the most without worrying about the dress too much. You can instead choose to embezzle it up with some nice, heavy jewellery like maang tikka, jhumki earrings or a necklace. Some also go for real flower jewels for this night, take your pick. You can play with colours here opting for any different hues of greens or blues as they sit well on the occasion.</p>
                                    <p><b>3. Haldi-</b> With this yellow-coloured ritual all set to bring the auspicious vibe of the wedding to your life, you are getting closer to the day of your dreams. The day, filled with sweets, emotions, dancing, fun and your folks, calls out for everything traditional. Yellow is definitely the ruling colour of every haldi function but you can mix and match shades of pink or green to the mix. The bride on this day will be all covered in haldi but a nice lightweight saree or a simple brocade/ silk straight kurta suit will be the perfect pick. Don’t forget to amp it up with the mock floral jewellery, a matching mag tikka piece of which is also given to the bridesmaids for making those pictures epic.</p>
                                    <p><b>4. Wedding Day-</b> And finally, it’s time for ‘din shagna da’ as the ultimate union of a bride and groom is closing in with every passing hour. With those wedding jitters in your stomach for real, you know that this is it. Bridal outfit on their wedding i.e. a heavy, royal, glittering lehenga is a piece of marvel unique to every bride’s taste but just the same in emotional value for all.</p>
                                    <p> While the typical classic colours opted for are vibrant hues of reds and maroon with a mix of green and gold and still make a popular choice by many brides who want that tinge of tradition intact on their special day. There are modern, more experimentative brides who like to go for more subtle colours such as beige, golds, pastel pinks or even sea green, which they can even easily wear after the day D at other times. That’s a smart move sure but if you like exclusivity, that’s also perfect.</p>
                                    <p><b>5. Reception-</b> You are now officially hitched with all love and hope for a beautiful future and reception is the first time, you will be introduced to the world as a ‘Mrs.’ and no longer ‘Ms.’. It’s a beautiful feeling to become part of a wonderful new family that you accept with all your heart and receive all the warmth in return. But this is the time, you are the ‘Queen of your Husband’s Life’ for real.</p>
                                    <p> Newly-wed brides can opt for either a traditional look with a nice heavy saree or lightweight, designer lehenga which is much more glamorous than the wedding one or keep it simple with an Indo-Western one-piece flowy long dress. Heavy cape/ shrugs with a trail and a basic inner gown are also quite in vogue. Colour choice for reception is fairly varied for brides; while some like to go for basic shades of pinks, beige, gold or copper, others like to play with English hues of blue, purple or orange.</p>
                                    <p> Now, these were some of the quick tips and ideas on how to dress right for every occasion, picking the best bridal outfits for all your memorable events.
