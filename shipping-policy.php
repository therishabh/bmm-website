            <h4 class="subHeading">How does the delivery process work?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once our system processes your order, your products are inspected thoroughly to ensure they are in a perfect
                    condition.</li>
                <li>After they pass through the final round of quality check, they are packed and handed over to our trusted
                    delivery partner.</li>
                <li>Our delivery partners then bring the package to you at the earliest possiblity. In case, they are unable to
                    reach your provided address or at a suitable time, they will contact you to resolve the issue.</li>
                <li>International Shipping – International clients do not pay import duties levied by their government to Book My Makeup.
                    Clients will have to pay the customs duty to the courier provider in order to receive the product.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subHeading">How are items packaged?</h4>
            <p>We package our products in boxes, which are covered in a plastic layer. Each individual product is packaged in
                bubble wrap while fragile items like bottles are safely secured with additional bubble wrap. </p>
            <p>We pride ourselves on the quality of our packaging. </p>

            <h4 class="subHeading">What is the range of locations to which Book My Makeup ships their products?</h4>
            <p>Book My Makeup ships throughout India! Book My Makeup now ships to Nepal; login soon to our website as we add more countries to our
                shipping locations.</p>


            <h4 class="subHeading">What is the estimated delivery time?</h4>
            <p>We usually dispatch most orders within 1-4 business days (excluding Sundays and public holidays)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Though, we keep 95% of our catalogue in our inventory, certain products need to be sourced directly from the
                    brand itself so that we can live up to our promise of providing fresh, non-expired products.</li>
                <li>While we are trying our best to avoid this situation, these products might delay your order. However, in
                    case of international orders, product delivery may get delayed due to reasons attributable to logistics,
                    public holidays, etc.</li>
                <li>If you are ordering our products from a Mega Sale event, dispatches may be a bit delayed due to increased
                    volumes. We will target to dispatch all orders within 5 days of order date.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subHeading">My order will be shipped in multiple shipments? What does this mean?</h4>
            <p>Don’t worry! This is a completely normal situation. This just means that different parts of your order may have
                simply been shipped from our different warehouse locations.
                Rest assured, you will only have to pay the shipping/CoD charge if applicable, on the first package you receive.
            </p>
            <p>International orders, in most instances, will be shipped in their entirety as one shipment.</p>

            <h4 class="subHeading">Are there any shipping charges applicable on my order?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We have standard shipping charges for most addresses.</li>
                <li> India shipping charges - A flat Rs.99 charge is applied to all orders below Rs.1000, while there is free shipping for all orders above Rs.1000. </li>
                <li>International shipping charges-A flat rate of all Rs.500 will be charged for all orders below Rs.5000,
                    while there is free shipping for all orders above Rs.5000.</li>
                <li>We are currently not accepting orders below Rs.500</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="subHeading">Does Book My Makeup ship outside India?</h4>
            <p>At present Book My Makeup ships only to Nepal. However, we are working on starting international delivery to many other
                countries, so stay tuned!</p>
